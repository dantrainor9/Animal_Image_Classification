# Animal_Image_Classification
A project using TensorFlow and Keras to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) able to classify color images of 151 different species of animals.

Data was gathered from Kaggle (source: https://www.kaggle.com/sharansmenon/animals141). Images were originally obtained via a search engine. Some images contain watermarks, signatures, or other identifying features.
